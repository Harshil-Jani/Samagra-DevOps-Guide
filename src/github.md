## Repositories
---
- [**samagra-devops**](https://github.com/Samagra-Development/samagra-devops) : It is the main repo that contains Jenkins job and Ansible roles for services that are reproducible in other projects at Samagra.
- Each project then contains a (project-name)-DevOps repo. For example [ULP-Devops](https://github.com/Unified-Learner-Passbook/ULP-devops) etc.

<!-- Here we can also talk about where are our Jenkinsfile stored. In build/Jenkins for all the project repos and similarly for Dockerfile. -->
